# Example app hangs on launch on iOS 
This is a native iOS app with flutter module. We use the single flutter engine pattern.

## Steps to reproduce
### on simulator
1. Run the iOS app
2. App hangs on launch

### on devices
1. Turn on VoiceOver or Switch Control in Accessibility settings
2. Run the iOS app
3. App hangs on launch

```
There is clear an re-entrance of method `flutter::PlatformViewIOS::SetOwnerViewController(fml::WeakNSObject<FlutterViewController> const&)` (in Flutter) (platform_view_ios.mm:84)

The implementation of this method
```
void PlatformViewIOS::SetOwnerViewController(__weak FlutterViewController* owner_controller) {
  FML_DCHECK(task_runners_.GetPlatformTaskRunner()->RunsTasksOnCurrentThread());
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(ios_surface_mutex_);
  if (ios_surface_ || !owner_controller) {
    NotifyDestroyed();
    ios_surface_.reset();
    accessibility_bridge_.Clear();
  }
```
std::mutex is not reentrant.

It's triggered by the enabling the AccessibilityBridge, as in the following code snippet. It may explain why this issue is reproducible in simulator or certain accessibility settings.
```
- (void)onAccessibilityStatusChanged:(NSNotification*)notification {
  if (!_engine) {
    return;
  }
  auto platformView = [_engine.get() platformView];
  int32_t flags = [self accessibilityFlags];
#if TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR
  // There doesn't appear to be any way to determine whether the accessibility
  // inspector is enabled on the simulator. We conservatively always turn on the
  // accessibility bridge in the simulator, but never assistive technology.
  platformView->SetSemanticsEnabled(true);
  platformView->SetAccessibilityFeatures(flags);
#else
  _isVoiceOverRunning = UIAccessibilityIsVoiceOverRunning();
  bool enabled = _isVoiceOverRunning || UIAccessibilityIsSwitchControlRunning();
  if (enabled) {
    flags |= static_cast<int32_t>(flutter::AccessibilityFeatureFlag::kAccessibleNavigation);
  }
  platformView->SetSemanticsEnabled(enabled || UIAccessibilityIsSpeakScreenEnabled());
  platformView->SetAccessibilityFeatures(flags);
#endif
}
```

However, on iOS 18.3.1, UIAccessibilityIsSwitchControlRunning() may return true even when the switch is off. Resulting crash on launch only on certain devices.

From the usage side, I understand that I probably shouldn't call warmupEngine in this case. But I think the engine itself should be robust enough to prevent itself from being deadlocked.
